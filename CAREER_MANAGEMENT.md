## Integration with Application System

### Career-Specific Applications
When users click "Apply Now" on a career card, they're redirected to:
```
/apply?career=career_id
```

The application form can use this career ID to:
- Pre-fill the position field
- Send career-specific application data
- Track which career the application is for

### Example Integration
```typescript
// In Apply component
const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
const careerId = urlParams.get('career');

if (careerId) {
  // Fetch career details
  const response = await fetch(`/api/careers/${careerId}`);
  const career = await response.json();
  
  // Pre-fill form with career title
  setFormData(prev => ({
    ...prev,
    position: career.title
  }));
}
```

## Sample Data

Use the provided `sample-careers.js` file to get started with sample career data. The file contains three example careers:
- Digital Marketing Specialist
- Video Editor  
- Web Developer

## Security Considerations

- All admin endpoints require authentication
- Career creation/editing is restricted to authenticated admins
- Public endpoints only return active careers by default
- Input validation on all form fields
- Rate limiting on API endpoints

## Environment Variables

Make sure these are set in your `.env.local`:
```env
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
ADMIN_USERNAME=your_admin_username
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_admin_password
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Careers not showing on public page:**
   - Check if careers are marked as `isActive: true`
   - Verify API endpoint `/api/careers?active=true` is working
   - Check browser console for errors

2. **Admin form not saving:**
   - Verify admin authentication
   - Check required fields are filled
   - Look for validation errors in browser console

3. **API errors:**
   - Check MongoDB connection
   - Verify environment variables
   - Check server logs for detailed error messages

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging by setting:
```env
DEBUG=true
```

This will provide detailed logs for API operations and database queries.
